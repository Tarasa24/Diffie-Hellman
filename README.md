## General info

This small project of mine serves the purpose of trying out new technologies and practices, as well as displaying interesting concept of modern cryptography. In essence it's my own interpretation of [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) and the project itself takes major inspiration / uses resources from said article.

## Technologies

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## Requirements

As this project uses [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) JavaScript object, it is necessary to use compatible browser, such a Chrome, Firefox or Opera. If you happen to have incompatible browser, feel free to at least look at the screenshots below.
